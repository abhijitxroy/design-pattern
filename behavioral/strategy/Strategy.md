# ðŸš€ Strategy Design Pattern

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.

## ðŸ“Œ Intent

> **"Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it."**

---

## âœ… When to Use

- You have multiple ways to perform a task (e.g., payment methods, sorting techniques).
- You want to switch between algorithms dynamically at runtime.
- You want to avoid `if-else` or `switch` statements based on behavior.
- You follow the **Open/Closed Principle** â€“ easily extend without modifying existing code.
